Mika wasn’t going to let herself end up like that, enduring a dull, uneventful life as some no-name Stukov only to die of old age having never really lived.

The Spitalians were just as bad, and far too clean – she wasn’t a fan of the bald-headed look anyway. That left one option, and it was an appealing one. Mika had fallen in love with the concept of the Carrion Birds from speaking to the members drifting through the bars of Downtown, listening to them amp each other up with outlandish tales of sticking it to the floppy hats, watching them strut around the streets in defiance of the rules, hearing whispered rumors of their misdeeds and vices in back alleys.

Pigshit.</p>\n<p>The stench overpowers everything, even the rotted corpse resting in the cart beside them, and it almost feels like they have to fight through it to even take a step closer.</p>\n<p>Soon after they can make out the town of Harm at the edge of the landscape, an industrial expanse of low ceilinged pigsties awaiting their arrival interrupted by tall methane tanks and blackened chimneys jutting up into the dark sky.</p>\n<p>They steadily make their way closer, soon only a few dozen meters from the outskirts of the town itself, the road before them passing through the charred iron gate where they were told to meet the Carrion Birds’ contact, but they’re suddenly interrupted by the clatter of galloping hooves behind them.</p>\n<h2>The Judge</h2>\n<p>Turning around, they see a Judge mounted on horseback bearing down on them.

A distinctive insignia gleams on his lapel, and an INT+Legends (3) roll will reveal the identity of the approaching Protector: Hawker, the leader of one of the mounted cavalry squadrons deployed to patrol and secure the Rubble.</p>\n<p>He’s one of the most powerful figures out here, and can call a dozen Judges for backup with little more than a snap of his fingers.</p>\n<p>“You folks been traveling from Justitian?” he asks, coming to a halt a few meters ahead of the group.</p>\n<p>“Providers gave me a warning of some suspicious travelers on their way to Harm that match your description, said you smelled an awful lot like something had gone and died.”</p>\n<p>He sniffs, dramatically, making a show of it. “Unfortunately, I ain’t smelling much but the pigs, so I’m going to have to ask you to let me inspect your possessions.”</p>\n<h2>Our Contact?</h2>\n<p>One last obstacle stands in the way of their goal, just a short distance away but impossible to reach.

If they instead choose to attempt to engage in an argument with the Judge, they’ll have to pull out all of their wits and tricks.</p>\n<h2>Conflict with Judge</h2>\n<p>The confrontation plays out as an extended Conflict, with every point and counterpoint represented by a roll. The Judge uses his INS+Perception and PSY+Cunning alternatively to see through the characters’ arguments, both of which he has an Action Number of (7) for, while they can use any appropriate Skill with which they can construct a solid argument for not allowing him to inspect their cargo.</p>\n<p>The argument continues with both sides accruing Successes until the difference in totals grows to (10), or 10 rolls have been made, at which point the contact notices the altercation and hurries over to bail them out.</p>\n<p>If the characters are able to win the argument, by convincing the Judge that he has the wrong group, baffling him with obscure medicinal obfuscation, appealing to his morality by claiming to be transporting the body of one of their relatives back to their hometown, or any other method, the Judge simply rides off, grumbling slightly.</p>\n<p>If he wins the argument, or is allowed to inspect the body, his suspicions skyrocket, and he demands to take the group back to Justitian for further questioning.</p>\n<h2>Bailed Out</h2>\n<p>Tensions run high, until the Harmid arrives.</p>\n<p>He greets the Protector like an old friend, taking him aside to speak in hushed tones at the side of the road. With a keen eye, a sheaf of Drafts can be spotted changing hands, before the Judge returns to speak to the characters. “Your... friend, there, has clarified the situation.</p>\n<p>Sorry to take up your time, folks, have a good day.
